              <strong>Dear Minion,</strong>
              <br />
              <p>
                <strong>Happy Valentine's Day!</strong>, <em>love of mine</em>.
                I just wanted to take a moment to tell you how much you mean to
                me. I truly appreciate the connection we share, and I can't wait
                for us to finally meet and hang out again.
                <br />
                I look forward to all the experiences we'll have together and
                the goals we'll achieve.
                <strong>You're my endless fuel and the reason</strong> I strive
                for a better, cooler, more exciting, and ambitious life.
                <strong>I want everything with you‚Äî</strong> your kisses, your
                dreams, your adventures, and your life projects.
                <br />
                <cite>I love you so much.</cite> I adore who you are, how you
                look, how you taste, your smile, and the love you give me.
                <br />
                <i> Your presence ignites a warmth in my heart, </i>
                and I can‚Äôt wait to feel your arms around me, sharing sweet
                moments together.
                <tt>
                  I crave the closeness of you next to me, whispering sweet
                  nothings in my ear. üòã
                </tt>
                <br />
                And Sorry about that last comment, when I think of you my mind
                starts to wander‚ÄîI can't help it.
                <br />
                <i>A letter can't fully express how much you mean to me.</i>
                <em
                  >I just want you in my life
                  <strong>now, tomorrow, forever and ever.</strong></em

              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Hope you're having a great day filled with love and good vibes.
                I'm looking forward to making unforgettable memories around the
                world together soon!
